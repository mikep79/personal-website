                    <strong>Full-stack JavaScript-based app designed to facilitate event planning and sharing by caregivers for people
                        with special needs. </strong>
                </p>
                <p>The app allows a user to register and sign in, create events tagged with accessibility and content needs,
                    and share with other users of the app. Users can register for an event and manage attendance in the My
                    Events page. Users who do not create an account will still be able to view the events, and will be able
                    to filter available events by content type and/or accessibility needs. As an example, a user with deafness
                    may click on tags for deafness and movies to find events such as movie showings at theatres with closed
                    captioning or an interpreter.

                    This app was built with the MEAN stack: Mongo Database, Express, Angular.js, Node.js.

                <p>Admin and guest are the users. Guests can access the survey form to enter their information about their business,
                    which adds this data to a database that can be acccessed by the admin side. The admin can create an account,
                    change password, and log in. Once logged in, admin can view the directory of all persons in the database,
                    read their information, update any line, and delete the person's profile. Admin can also create connections
                    between profiles and add comments about profile or connection.
